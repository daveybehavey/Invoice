# User Testing Plan (Current Build)

## Objective
Validate whether real users can complete the full loop:
`messy notes -> generate -> review/edit -> print/PDF -> save`

## Test Sample
- 5 to 10 users.
- Prefer target users: small service business owners/operators.

## Session Format
- 15 to 20 minutes each.
- Think-aloud encouraged.
- Moderator only helps if blocked.

## Tasks
1. Paste messy notes and generate invoice.
2. Complete any follow-up questions (labor pricing and/or tone).
3. Edit one line item value.
4. Rewrite one line item text.
5. Rewrite full invoice text.
6. Print invoice (or Save as PDF).
7. Save invoice.

## What to Capture
- Time to first generated invoice.
- Number of clarification questions asked by user.
- Where user hesitates or gets stuck.
- Whether pricing/totals are trusted.
- Whether user believes output is sendable.

## Severity Labels
- Blocker: cannot complete flow.
- Major: completes flow with confusion/risk.
- Minor: friction but task still clear.

## Success Criteria
- >= 80% complete full flow without moderator intervention.
- <= 1 blocker across 5+ sessions.
- Majority report they would send output after light edits.
