# AI Invoice Helper Roadmap

## Product North Star
AI feels like ChatGPT: powerful intake, explicit money decisions, and a safe editable draft.

## Shipped (as of 2026-02-18)
1. Post-generate AI edits
   - "Edit with AI" in manual editor with apply/discard guard.
2. Review step clarity
   - Review snapshot + progressive details.
3. Messy-input UX copy pass
   - Cleaner, shorter copy in intake + follow-up + decision blocks.
4. One-tap edit chips
   - Quick action chips (rate/hours/remove/update client/merge duplicates).
5. Decision wording simplification
   - Add/Skip wording and clearer decision explanations.
6. "What I understood" micro-summary
   - Found / Decisions / Next step summary line.
7. Undo last decision
   - Decision toast + undo rollback window.
8. Saved rate preset (local)
   - Reuses last hourly rate in labor follow-up.
9. Decision grouping/pagination
   - One-decision focus with optional "See all decisions".
10. Service period helper
   - Infers start/end range from multiple explicit dates.
11. Merge duplicate items suggestion
   - Detects duplicate parts and offers merge action.
12. Photo notes intake (OCR + required review)
   - Image OCR endpoint + required user text review before parsing.
   - Existing money decision/confirmation gates unchanged.
13. OCR and upload guardrails
   - 8MB upload cap, image-type checks, OCR warning surfacing.
14. Draft polish pass
   - Stronger line-item wording cleanup across intake + manual editor.
   - Description cleanup keeps all qty/rate/amount math untouched.

## Next (current priorities)
1. Real-user messy-flow QA pack
   - Add a repeatable "messy script" regression set (API + UI).
   - Capture friction notes and expected outputs.
2. Mobile intake simplification (state-density pass)
   - Keep decision-first focus on small screens.
   - Continue hiding non-critical controls until needed.
3. OCR confidence indicator
   - Add explicit High/Medium/Low confidence label in review block.
4. Canonical readiness contract
   - Centralize canGenerate / openDecisions / follow-up readiness in one evaluator.
   - Use evaluator output for phase transitions + generate button state.

## Success Criteria (lean)
- Users can complete a messy intake without confusion.
- No money decisions happen without explicit confirmation.
- Post-generate edits feel safe and fast.
- Testing remains deterministic.
